[Recovered Audio Transcription — RADIO BAOBAB // Looping anomaly]

███ SIGNAL LOCKED ██

🎙️ “This is Radio Baobab…  
back from the static, deep in the mesh.

He left behind the signal —
a poem, a code.”

🎵

    The light blinks twice before it’s gone,     
    A rusted wire hums just once.                  
    Three shadows move beneath the node,           
    But only one leaves silent tones.              

    The fourth floor light never worked,        
    Yet five cables hang from it still.            
    A sixth breath caught in copper lung,          
    Then silence wraps the hill.                 

🎙️ “Loop ends at 33 seconds sharp.  
   Trace the numbers.  
   That’s where he hid the next mask.”

███ TRANSMISSION ENDS ██
